# CourseraMachineLearning
You can either use matlab or octave to run codes

#### 1. Linear and polynomial regression models
`ex1.mx` is the guide file, you can follow the instructions.
#### 2. Logistic regression
`ex2.mx` is the guide file, you can follow the instructions.
#### 3. Multi-class classification model and classifying digit image
`ex3.mx` is the guide file, you can follow the instructions.
#### 4. Neural Networks
`ex4.mx` is the guide file, you can follow the instruction to build a Neural Network
#### 5. Advice for Applying Machine Learning
`ex5.mx` is the guide file, you can follow the instruction to learn basic level tuning for your ML model.
#### 6. Support Vector Machines
`ex6.mx` is the guide file you can follow the instruction to learn SVM and most importantly you'll develop a Spam Classifier.

`ex7.mx` is the guide file you can follow the instruction to apply K-Means and Principal Component Analysis. You can also learn dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of a sample.
`ex8.mx' is the guid file you can follow the instruction to apply Anomaly Detection and to develop Recommender Systems.
* In the first part of the exercise an Anomaly Detection Model is developed by using Gaussian Distribution and Threshold is defined by F1 Score.
